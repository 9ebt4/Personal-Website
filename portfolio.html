        <p> &emsp; Here you can find a list of a number of my favorite projects that I have worked on at Grand Circus. While some have errors and need polish they truly highlight the growth that I have had since beginning my coding journey.</p>

        <p>This was one of my very first deliverables! It could use some TLC but it is great for highlighting when my initial love for coding was sparked.</p>

        <p>This was one of the more challenging initial programs that I put together. I was quite happy that the software was able to determine any number or symbol placed into the sentence and return it unbroken. </p>

        <p>This deliverable was a personal favorite of mine. I was able to create two File.IO systems and make them cross communicate to ensure that users of the library had all of their checked out books save to their profiles. </p>
