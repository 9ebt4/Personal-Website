        <p> &emsp; I am Ethan Thomas. I am a driven individual with a passion for technology. A bit about me. I am a nerd and love to play D&D while I also strive to build a sustainable farm and live a self-sufficient lifestyle.<br/><br/>

            &emsp;After several years as a dietitian, I made the decision to switch to the tech field in order to have more time for my family and pursue my interests in technology. I am currently enrolled in Grand Circus, a coding bootcamp where I am learning the ins and outs of software development, specifically in C# .NET, SQL and HTML.<br/><br/>
            
            &emsp;Through my studies at Grand Circus, I have gained a deeper understanding of the impact that technology can have in various industries, including health and wellness. I am excited to bring my unique background as a dietitian to the tech field and use my skills to create innovative solutions that improve people's lives.<br/><br/>
            
            &emsp;Overall, I am eager to continue my journey as a software developer and make a positive impact in the world through my work. I look forward to connecting with others in the tech industry and continuing to expand my skills and knowledge through new opportunities and challenges.</p>
